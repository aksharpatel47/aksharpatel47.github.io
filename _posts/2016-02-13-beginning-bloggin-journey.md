title: Starting Blogging Journey with Swift and iOS
---

I always wanted to blog. Started a couple of times before, but abandoned the blogs as I didn't have any motivation
to continue. What changed now, you ask? Me.

Well, over the last couple of years, I have learnt that it is very important to invest in yourself to advance
in the crazy fast paced changing field of software development. I did a couple of certificate courses on Coursera,
went over a lot of web based courses on Udacity, bought a paid subscription to both Pluralsight and Egghead (Well
worth the money). Recently my job required me to learn swift and iOS development. After finishing introductory
tutorials on Pluralsight, I looked at the courses available on udacity. The intro to iOS development course
encouraged learning by googling problems and blogging. And to tell the truth I fell in love writing swift as a
language and the ecosystem of iOS development. John Somnez from simpleprogrammer also encouraged blogging. A lot
of developers I follow in twitter also recommend blogging as a way to grow.

So this is my fresh start at blogging. I'll be going through Udacity and Pluralsight's entire range of iOS
courses and blogging about the problems faced and solutions. Please feel free to point out my mistakes. I'm
learning. I hope my blog helps you out in any way possible.

Thanks for reading this and wish me luck.
