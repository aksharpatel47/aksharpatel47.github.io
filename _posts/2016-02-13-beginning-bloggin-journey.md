title: Starting Blogging Journey with Swift and iOS
---

I always wanted to blog. Had started a couple of times in the past, but abandoned the blogs 
as I didn't think it would be worth the time to maintain them. What changed now, you ask? Me.

Well, over the last couple of years, I have learnt that it is very important to invest in yourself to advance
in the crazy fast paced and ever-changing field of software development. I started with a couple of 
certificate courses on Android Development on Coursera, went over a lot of web courses on Udacity, 
bought a paid subscription to both Pluralsight and Egghead (Well worth the money) and learned Javascript,
AngularJS, Node.js, C# and ASP.Net Core.

My current job required me to learn Swift and iOS development. I liked Swift from the get go due to it
 being very similar to Javascript and C#. So, after finishing introductory tutorials on Pluralsight,
 I looked at the courses available on Udacity. The intro to iOS development course encouraged learning 
 by googling problems and blogging about it. A lot of developers I follow on Twitter also recommend
 blogging as a way to grow. So I decided:

This is my fresh start at blogging. Third time's a charm. I'll be going through the entire range
 of courses on iOS on Udacity and Pluralsight and blogging about the problems I faced with their solutions.
 Please feel free to point out my mistakes. I'm  forever learning. I hope my blog helps you out in 
 any way possible.

Thank you for reading this and wish me luck.
